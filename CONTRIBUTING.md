# Code Contributions
## Code Formatting
Code needs to be formatted according to the rules in rustfmt.toml. Easiest way to achieve this is to run
```> cargo +nightly fmt```

If you run into this error ```rust error[internal]: left behind trailing whitespace ``` 
run ```> cargo fmt``` once before running the above command.

Note* You need nightly installed on you machine.
